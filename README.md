## What is this project?

Sily, mostly.

An attempt at a Discord bot, used at the Cirkeltrek Discord server.

There's not anything special about what it can do, it mostly features things that I believe are funny (like cat-posting). Among other things it can do this:
..* Giving fun facts about space, theories about space and the like
..* Sending a random song of the genre you choose
..* Giving reminders about things to do and when
..* Letting people know you want to toke and how high you are
..* And more as soon as i can think of it

## How to add this bot to your server?

Why would you do that. If you're a coding rookie then don't. If you are a capable developer then you're probably better off making your own or just forking this repository and make any changes there to make it work.

Tip: config.json in the root.

## Calling the bot

Prefix can be set inside the config.json with *gasp "prefix".
